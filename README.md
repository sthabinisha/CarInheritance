Car Inheritance 

In this challenge, you will be asked to build on an abstract class and initialize an instance of each class with a variable. The program will then test your implementation by retrieving the data you stored. 

The locked code in the editor does the following: 

 1. Declares an abstract class named Car with the implementations for getIsSedan() and getSeats() methods, as well as an abstract method named getMileage(). 

 2. Creates WagonR Honda City, or InnovaCrysta object based on input (O for WagonR, 1 for Honda City and 2 for InnovaCrysta). 

 3. Calls the getIsSedan ().getSeats(), and getMileage () methods on the object. Gass Dugas Car Sedan Boom Sieg +Carbadan den Bedan) Boolean .Seving M O : String Honda Honda -el ): String Innovaya • Mengering The details for each car are provided below

 //write your code here.

/**
*   WagonR class
**/

/**
*   HondaCity class
**/

/**
*   InnovaCrysta class
**/

 The details for each car are provided below -

  1. WagonR is not a sedan and has 4 seats. 
  2. Honda City is a sedan and has 4 seats. 
  3. InnovaCrysta is not a sedan and has 6 seats. 

  Complete the code in the editor below to implement the following: 

  1. Three classes named, WagonR HondaCity, and InnovaCrysta that inherit from the Car class. 
  2. One integer argument is provided to the constructor which is the mileage of the car. 
  3. Each class must implement the getMileage() method which returns a string in the form of <mileage> kmpl where <mileage> is the value provided to constructor. 

  	Constraints 
  	• The integer in first line will be in between 0 and 2 inclusive. 
  	• The integer in the second line (i.e. mileage will be in between 5 and 30 inclusive. 

  	 Sample Input For Custom Testing

  	 Sample Output
  	  A WagonR is not Sedan, is 4-seater
